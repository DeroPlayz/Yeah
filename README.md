# Welcome to an unfinished game!

## Player Data
As a player, you will have various values. By the way, this is gonna be a manual and me just talking about the development sorta.

### Name
The name of your character. Fairly self explanatory.

### Gender & Pronouns
Yeah, my text-based RPG has pronouns. Does that *trigger* you, liberal? Anyways, yeah. You can choose the gender of your character, which is gonna play a part in the story at some point. Maybe. I don't know. But you *will* be able to choose custom ✨pronouns!✨

### Health and Spirit Points
The two main meters you will be managing. As always, when your HP reaches 0, you die. Additionally, HP is used to cast physical moves and SP is used on magic; offense, healing, etc.
### Attack (ATK), Magic (MAG), Defense (DEF), and Agility (AGI)
The four stats you will be growing on the adventure.<br>
Attack - Dictates the damage dealt by your physical moves.<br>
Magic - Dictates the damage dealt by your magic moves, as well as how much health your healing spells heal.<br>
Defense - Dictates how much the damage you take is reduced.<br>
Agility - Dictates move order in combat and hit/dodge rate.

### Affinities
The protagonist doesn't start with any affinities. They are determined by your actions.

## Elements & Affinities
Elements are how the various moves in the game are categorized. Most elements are offense magic, but some non-offense magic will be tied to "elements" too because f*** you, that's why.

### <font color="red">Fire</font> - Can inflict burn.*
### <font color="blue">Ice</font> - Can inflict freeze.*
### <font color="yellow">Electric</font> - Can inflict shock/stun/paralysis* (all the same in this case).
### <font color="lime">Wind</font> - No nonsense wind magic.
### <font color="beige">Light</font> - placeholder unique trait.
### <font color="maroon">Dark</font> - placeholder unique trait.
### <font color="grey">Almighty</font> - A concentrated, potent form of magic that can be blocked by almost no means.
##### *If I implement ailmets
